					<h2 id="content">Introduction</h2>
					<p style="color: black">In November 1988, the Cebu City Government entered into an agreement with the Department of Labor and Employment to cooperate with the latter in solving/minimizing the region’s unemployment and underemployment problem. Embodied in the Memorandum of Agreement were the commitments and roles that both parties were play in this venture. They both jointly formed the Community Employment Center (CEC), a mini employment exchange to provide employment assistance to the region’s unemployed. It was envisioned to serve as a conduit between the Department of Labor and Employment and far-flung municipalities for the dispersal of job vacancies and applicants away from the urban metropolitan areas.</p>

					<p style="color: black" >Sometime in 1989, the Community EmploymentCenter became Operational in Cebu City Hall, but it did not have a good following, hence it fizzled out. Later on, in 1990, the Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) issued a Memorandum Circular, No. 90-21, directing all regional directors, provincial governors, city and municipal mayors to organize Community Employment Centers in their respective local government units.</p>

					<p style="color: black">About this time, the war in the Gulf region was at its peak. Drawing inspiration from this historic event, Vice-Mayor Alvin B. Garcia then sponsored a resolution creating EmploymentCenter in CebuCity Hall, presumably for the purpose of helping Cebuanos get jobs in the war-torn Arab states. Thus, the birth of the Employment Opportunities Office (EOO) in CebuCity Hall. Its first big missionwas to list applications for overseas employment.</p>

					<p style="color: black">Hundreds of people thronged Cebu City Hall when word got around that it was a listing applicants for possible overseas jobs. On March 8, 1991, the EOO, based at first in the Cebu City Vice Mayor’s Office and later in the MICS office, began listing applicants and started a data buildup of all data gathered. This databank later proved to be useful whenever there were hirings coursed through Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and legitimate private recruitment agencies. POEA would request for printouts of specific information regarding applicants with certain qualifications and work experiences.</p>

					<p style="color: black">EOO started overseas service assistance only, but it gradually expanded to include local employment until the then Honorable Councilor Michael L. Rama (now Cebu City Mayor) got elected in 1992 and assumed the position as consultant to EOO, which was later changed to Employment and Placement Opportunities Center (EPOC) with a very improved and expanded services. It enjoys popularity and prestige in the local labor front and has direct contact with prospective employers and has earned the respect of its clientele.</p>

					<p style="color: black">Because of these, the Cebu City Council passed and Ordinance to order to institutionalized the EPOC through a merger between the Public Welfare Division and EPOC and the same was approved on July 7, 1994 by no less than the then Honorable Cebu City Mayor (now the Representative of the First District of Cebu City) Tomas R. Osmeña. The department is now known as the Department of Manpower Development and Placement (DMDP).</p>
